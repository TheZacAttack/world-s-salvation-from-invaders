# Space-Invaders
Sattler CS 208 Program Design Space Invaders

If you would like to run this game you will need DrRacket program on your computer.
As soon as you have DrRacket you can place our code in the upper window.
We used images for the EARTH, FIRE, UFO, MISSILE, and COMMET; so you will need to provide images for those before rinning the program.
After you have implemented the images you can hit the green RUN button at the top right of the screen.
Have fun playing or reading our code. 
Hit me up if you have questions.
